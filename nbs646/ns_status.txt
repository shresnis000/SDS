On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        ns_noadd.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Explanation:

The first sentence means that my local repository is up to date with the remote repository

The second sentence means that there is an untracked file in my local working directory, ns_noadd.txt, that is not in my local repo and is not staged for a commit

The third sentence means that there is nothing in my staging are to commit, but once again mentions that there are untracked files, ns_noadd.txt, that could be commited
