Initially, Git was difficult to learn. I had not spent much time using revision control software because I had worked on small, individual coding ejects. Each of these projects were done in environment with intuitive GUIs. When I started this course, I was introduced to Linux/UNIX, and there was a sharp learning curve in shell-based environments. Most of my hurdles stemmed from being unaccustomed with Linux and not understanding the concept of revision control.

After the first few weeks of class, I began to enjoy Git more. It became quite intuitive due to its concise list of commands. I have been taking micro courses in concert with SDS335 and they use different revision control system (e.g perforce). I understand Git has a GUI counterpart, and as I create deeper Git repositories, I would love to learn more about those systems.
