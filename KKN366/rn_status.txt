On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	rn_noadd.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


Explanation:
The first line is noting that I (Ren) am on the main branch. Git allows multiple branches to exist which can be used for beta testing without breaking the mainline.

"rn_noadd.txt" is noted under untracked files. This file only exists in my local clone of the mainline. Others will not be able to access the file nor pull it.

The final line notes that there are no files commited and pending a "push".
